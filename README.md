# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# Description of components

- FlatList: In the project, have a FlatList that I use to map over data elements in an array. These elements in the array get mapped over and rendered as a list. This component takes in some props such as data(the data elements to render in the list), keyExtractor(this is a key that is associated to each data item to set it up for mapping), renderItem(this is a prop that actually performs the mapping of the data elements). Other props exist though, but I would like to talk about these for now.
- SafeAreaView: This is a component that helps to align the elements in the app or the components in the array rightly with the mobile screen. It displays elements in a safe area on the screen to prevent them from overlapping with some already existing parts of a screen such as the status bar.
- ScrollView: The ScrollView component is a component that enables auto scrolling when the elements of the screen exceed the normal height of the screen. Without it, scrolling will not be possible.
- Image: The Image component is a component that is used to render images. This is similar to the img tag in html. The Image takes in a source prop that is the source of the image to render.
- Text: The Text component is used to render normal text elements.
- TextInput: The TextInput component is used to render elements that take in user inputs.
- View: The View is one primary component that wraps other components as a container.
- KeyboardAvoidingView: This is a component that is used to prevent the keyboard from interrupting with other views when invoked.
